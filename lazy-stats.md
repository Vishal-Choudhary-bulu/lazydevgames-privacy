# Privacy Policy for Lazy Stats

**Effective Date: February 16, 2026**  
**Last Updated: February 16, 2026**

## Overview
Lazy Stats is a macOS menu bar utility by Lazydev that shows real-time system health metrics on your Mac. We built it with a privacy-first approach: processing is local, and we do not collect personal data.

## What Lazy Stats Accesses (On-Device Only)
To display system status, Lazy Stats reads the following information locally on your Mac:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage and breakdown
- Storage usage
- Battery health, cycle count, and condition
- Thermal state
- System uptime
- Top running processes (process name and CPU/memory usage)
- Network throughput (upload/download byte rates)

This data is used only for live display in the app.

## Data Collection, Transmission, and Sharing
- We do **not** collect personal data.
- We do **not** transmit data to Lazydev servers.
- We do **not** use cloud storage, user accounts, or sign-in.
- We do **not** share, sell, or disclose user data to third parties.
- We do **not** use tracking or cross-app tracking.

## Data Retention
Lazy Stats does **not** maintain user profiles or synced history. Metrics are processed in memory for real-time display and are **not** transmitted to any servers.

## Permissions
Lazy Stats does **not** request access to personal data categories such as:
- Contacts

## Security

## Children's Privacy
Lazy Stats is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Your Privacy Rights (GDPR/CCPA-Style Notice)
Depending on your region, privacy laws may provide rights such as the right to know, access, delete, correct, or opt out of certain data uses/sales.  
Because Lazy Stats does not collect personal data, these rights are generally not applicable in practice for this app. If you have a privacy request, contact us and we will respond in accordance with applicable law.
