# Privacy Policy for Leaf Lore

**Last Updated: December 27, 2025**

## Overview
Leaf Lore is an AI-assisted interactive story writing app where you guide the narrative by choosing what happens next. We're committed to keeping your data private.

## What We Collect
**Very little. Just the basics to make the app work.**

**We DON'T collect:**
- Personal information (name, address, email, phone, etc.)
- Analytics or usage tracking
- Device information
- Location data

**We DO collect:**
- **Your stories**: The AI-generated stories and your choices are stored on our servers (needed for AI generation and syncing across devices)
- **Sign-in info**: When you use Google Play Games or Apple Game Center, we get a basic ID to save your progress across devices (no personal details)
- **Purchase records**: What you bought in the app, so we can give you what you paid for

## How It Works
- AI generates stories on our backend servers
- Your stories and choices are saved in our database so you can access them from any device
- Sign in with Google/Apple to sync your stories across devices
- No analytics, no tracking

## Third-Party Services

### Google Play Games (Android)
- Used for sign-in and cloud saves
- Governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- We receive only a player identifier, no personal information

### Apple Game Center (iOS)
- Used for sign-in and cloud saves
- Governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)
- **Google Play Games** and **Apple Game Center** for sign-in (they handle authentication, we just get an ID)
- **Apple/Google** for in-app purchases (they process payments, we never see your payment info)

## Age Requirement
Leaf Lore is rated 13+ because AI-generated stories may contain content not suitable for younger children.

## Your Rights
- Delete your data by contacting us at support@lazydevgames.com
- We'll answer any questions about your data (spoiler: we barely have any)
- Google Play Store Guidelines
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

**Summary: We collect only what's necessary to provide game functionality—sign-in through Apple/Google services and purchase records. No analytics, no tracking, no unnecessary data collection.**

**TL;DR:** We collect almost nothing. Just sign-in IDs and purchase records. No analytics and no tracking.
